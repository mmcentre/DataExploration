# DataExploration

Course materials: Data Exploration Using Relational DBMS
--------------------------------------------------------

**Prepared for *Harvard University FAS Research Computing training***

Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are the most popular environment for storing and retrieving data used in
research. Participants will learn the basics of data manipulation in RDBMS. They will learn how to create a table within
a database, load simple tabular data, explore the data and execute simple queries. We will discuss when and what kind of
optimizations might be required to handle the data efficiently. Together we will install a minimal RDBMS using a ready
docker-compose image, write a simple Python script to ingest a CSV file, and create a simple dashboard visualizing the
data.
